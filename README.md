A quick web tool to help my Code Club students "draw" pictures for the Raspberry Pi Astro Pi:Mission Zero project (https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/astro-pi-mission-zero)

Allows user to pick colours from a predefined palette and set the individual pixels of the 8x8 display.  Automatically generates formatted Python ready to add to the rest of the Mission Zero code
